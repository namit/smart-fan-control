=================

Control the speed of a Mac’s HDD fan based on the S.M.A.R.T. temperature reported by the drive.

### About

Inspired by [this hint](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20110704054835249), this script sets the speed of the HDD fan based on the temperature reported by the drive itself.

This script attempts to achieve something similar to [HDD Fan Control](http://www.hddfancontrol.com/), minus the price tag and nice GUI.

### Warning

Use this totally at your own risk. This is practically untested and has been knocked together pretty quickly. In fact, you shouldn't really even use this.

### Requirements

1. <code>smartctl</code> from the [smartmontools](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/smartmontools/) package. I use [macports](http://www.macports.org/):
    
        $ port install smartmontools

2. <code>[smc](https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl/tree/master/smc-command)</code> from [smcFanControl](https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl). <code>smc</code> needs to be run as root, or otherwise owned by root with setuid.
    
        $ sudo chown root:admin smc
        $ sudo chmod +s smc
    
    Currently, <code>smc</code> needs to be installed at <code>/usr/local/sbin/smc</code>.

### Installation

    sudo make install

It makes sense to schedule this script to run at a regular interval. There's a <code>launchd</code> plist included to run it every minute.

    sudo make install-launchd
